# Ankit Jindal's GitHub Profile

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

Hi there! I'm Ankit Jindal, a **DevOps Engineer** with a background in **SEO** and a strong interest in cloud technologies. After spending 3.5 years working as a Senior SEO Specialist, I decided to switch to a more technical and growth-driven role in **DevOps**. Although I come from a commerce background, I‚Äôve always been fascinated by the technical side of things, especially how automation, infrastructure, and cloud systems work.

Currently, I‚Äôm focused on **learning DevOps tools**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and **cloud computing** as I look for new opportunities in this field.

### Why the Switch?
I‚Äôve always enjoyed working with websites and marketing strategies, but I realized that my true passion lies in technical solutions. I‚Äôm excited about cloud infrastructure, automation, and DevOps practices like GitOps, CI/CD, containerization, and monitoring. 

### Current Focus
I am actively learning from the ground up, studying software development, system administration, and cloud management while working on real-life projects like **MERN Stack Blog Platform Deployment** and **AWS Lambda for automated EBS Snapshot Cleanup**.
