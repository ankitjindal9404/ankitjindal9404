# Hi 👋, I'm Ankit Jindal, DevOps Engineer

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm Ankit Jindal, a **DevOps Engineer** with a background in **SEO** and a strong interest in cloud technologies.

Currently, I’m focused on **learning DevOps tools**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and **cloud computing** as I look for new opportunities in this field.

### Why the Switch?
I’ve always enjoyed working with websites and marketing strategies, but I realized that my true passion lies in technical solutions. I’m excited about cloud infrastructure, automation, and DevOps practices like GitOps, CI/CD, containerization, and monitoring. 

### Current Focus
I am actively learning from the ground up, studying software development, system administration, and cloud management while working on real-life projects like **MERN Stack Blog Platform Deployment** and **AWS Lambda for automated EBS Snapshot Cleanup**.
